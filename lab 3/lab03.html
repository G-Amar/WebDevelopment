    <h1>Comparing HTML/CSS and Bootstrap for Responsive Design</h1>
    <p>Regarding challenges faced, both versions had different challenges. 
      For HTML/CSS, writing out all the classes for the columns became tedious,
      but allowed for much more customization. For Bootstrap, ther was less 
      boilerplate code but customizing was a little more work. Overall,
      both methods have their pros and cons, and I can see how someone
      would prefer one method over the other.</p>
    <p>Personally though, I prefer the pure HTML/CSS method of responsive design.
      Despite the Bootstrap method overall being a little easier and faster,
      I enjoy having more control over the format and presentation of the 
      website that I am creating. This was a fun assignment!
